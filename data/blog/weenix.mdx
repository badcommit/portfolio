One of the most challenging courses for master's students at USC is the kernel course. The primary objective of this course is to teach students how to develop a basic kernel. The project itself is based on the curriculum from Brown University, and you can find more information about it on this link: https://brown-cs1690.github.io/brown-cs167-s22/#/

Throughout the course, we engage in various labs that involve implementing threads, processes, file systems, and virtual memory. These labs are an essential part of the learning process, helping students gain hands-on experience with kernel development.

As the labs are private to USC, a few insights and lessons learned can be shared here. The course is likely to be an intensive and immersive experience, challenging students to delve deep into the intricacies of kernel programming and operating systems. It equips them with valuable skills and knowledge required for advanced system-level development and lays a strong foundation for their future in computer science.

## Threads and Process

### Process

The first lab in the kernel course involves implementing threads, processes, and synchronization primitives.

For the process data structure, in addition to holding basic information such as pid and ppid, it also incorporates other structures to provide abstraction.

To implement the waitpid function, a list of child processes is utilized. The waitpid implementation involves scanning the list of child processes to find the exiting process, and then the kernel stack of child process is destroyed to collect its resources.

Moreover, the process maintains a list of open files to implement file descriptors. File descriptors abstract the inode in the file system and store information like the file's offset, inode pointer, open mode and reference count.

The process data structure also requires a pointer to the list it waits on, used when waiting for a process to terminate. Similarly, it contains a list of processes that are waiting on it, which is essential for implementing the waitpid function. When the process dies, it must wake up all the processes waiting on it.

Additional structures are used to handle virtual memory mapping, such as vmmap and brk pointers.

The implementation of the process abstraction relies heavily on list data structures, and the Weenix environment offers numerous utility functions to facilitate the implementation process. These utilities streamline the development of the process-related functionalities, making the task more manageable and efficient.

### Threads

The design of threads in the kernel course is more intricate, as they involve direct interaction with hardware functionalities, such as switching thread context.

The thread context comprises registers, page directory, and the thread's stack start pointer. The page directory is utilized to flush the cr3 register, while the stack pointer is employed to switch the stack pointer.

Additionally, each thread needs to have a pointer to the list it waits on, allowing it to wait for events like mutexes, file system operations, or other synchronization primitives.

One of the critical functionalities of threads is providing context switching between different threads. Part of this context switch is implemented through assembly code. The assembly code is responsible for saving and restoring registers and managing interrupts by disabling and enabling them.

Furthermore, the context switch requires fetching the next thread from a run queue, switching the page directory to the new thread's context, and updating the stack pointer accordingly.

Implementing thread functionalities involves a careful orchestration of low-level hardware interactions and data structures. It requires attention to detail and efficient use of hardware resources to ensure smooth context switching and proper synchronization among threads. The assembly code plays a crucial role in managing the state of threads during context switches, enabling the kernel to handle multitasking and efficiently execute multiple threads concurrently.

### Mutex

Indeed, since Weenix supports a single core and does not have preemptive multitasking, the implementation of mutexes can be relatively straightforward.

When a thread tries to acquire a mutex that is already locked by another thread, it inserts itself into the waitlist associated with that mutex and then voluntarily switches to another thread. This voluntary thread switching allows other threads to continue executing while the current thread is waiting for the mutex to become available.

Without preemptive multitasking, a thread will hold the mutex until it explicitly releases it. Once a thread releases the mutex, it will wake up one of the waiting threads from the waitlist, allowing that thread to acquire the mutex and proceed with its execution.

The simplicity of mutex implementation in Weenix is due to the absence of preemption, where threads do not get preempted by the operating system scheduler. Instead, threads voluntarily yield control to other threads when they encounter a synchronization primitive like a mutex, making the coordination of shared resources relatively straightforward in this single-core environment.

## Virtual File System

Indeed, implementing a file system based on the inode abstraction can introduce challenges, especially when supporting polymorphism. The kernel needs to accommodate different file systems, each with its own unique implementation of read, write, lookup, create, link, unlink, mkdir, rmdir, stat, getdents, and other file system operations.

```bash
$ cat foo.txt > /home/bar.txt
$ cat foo.txt > /dev/tty0
$ cat foo.txt > /proc/123/mem
```

will have different implementation of the read function.

The Weenix file system introduces an additional layer of abstraction called VFS (Virtual File System), which involves the use of the vnode data structure. VFS acts as an intermediary layer, binding different file system implementations together.

Each vnode in VFS contains a list of function pointers that the underlying file system should provide. These function pointers represent the implementation of various file system operations. This design allows different file systems to provide their own custom implementations while adhering to a common interface.

It is noteworthy that most kernel operations should operate on the concept of vnode rather than inode. However, the kernel ensures that each file system has a unique inode to avoid memory duplication.

To manage vnodes effectively, the kernel maintains a global vnode table. Whenever a new vnode is created for a specific file system, the kernel calls the file system to initialize it properly.

Deciding which operation could be block and handling the blocking of certain vnode operations can be complex. To mitigate this, the kernel employs various techniques such as marking vnodes as dirty or busy instead of writing to disk directly. In situations where blocking is necessary, the kernel sleeps on a specific queue and performs context switching.

Another challenging aspect of the implementation is managing the vnode reference count, which is vital for flushing inodes to disk properly. Debugging this part of the system requires considerable effort.

In summary, each time Weenix generates and exposes a pointer to an external function, it should increase the reference count. Conversely, when taking over a reference in some data structure and setting it to null, the reference count should be decreased.

The complexity involved in managing vnodes and inode references highlights the advantages of languages like Rust, which emphasize memory safety and help prevent common memory bugs. Rust's strict ownership model and borrow checker can significantly reduce the risk of memory-related issues and save development time in the long run. As a result, Rust has gained popularity, particularly in systems programming, where memory safety is crucial.

## Virtual Memory

The primary goal of Weenix is to support mmap and COW fork functionality, making it a comprehensive operating system that can handle memory mapping and process duplication efficiently.

To achieve mmap functionality, Weenix introduces the memory object data structure, which represents the underlying memory mapped to a specific region. This memory object can represent various sources, including files, anonymous memory, or private shadow copies of parent memory.

Within the process data structure, Weenix maintains a list of vmarea mappings. Each vmarea acts as a bridge between virtual memory addresses and the underlying memory object. It contains information such as the start address, end address, flags, and the associated memory object. This arrangement enables the kernel to efficiently find the memory object when a user space program accesses a specific area, allowing for polymorphism and flexibility in supporting different memory objects.

To manage physical memory, Weenix uses the pframe data structure. Whenever data is written to a page, it goes through the pframe, which maintains status indicators like "dirty" or "busy" or pinned status. Other kernel module relies on pframe assistance to operate on physical memory for read and write operations. This approach allow the kernel to track pframe status and notify the underlying memory object of changes in a more efficient way, since most operation will be blocked

Implementing mmap and fork functionality is indeed challenging due to the complexity of interactions between virtual memory, processes, file systems, and the underlying polymorphism. Debugging such complex systems can be time-consuming and demanding. For instance, one particular bug took 5 hours to debug. It was related to the shadow object used to implement the fork functionality. The bug caused kernel stack overflow due to a recursion method used while freeing the shadow object that mapped parent memory to child.

In summary, the implementation of mmap and fork in Weenix is interesting and involves careful management of virtual memory, process duplication, and polymorphism with various memory objects.
